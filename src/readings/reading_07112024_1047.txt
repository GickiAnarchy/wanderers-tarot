Ah, love... a fickle thing, indeed.  The cards tell a tale of strength and resilience, but also of dimmed joy and a journey turned astray.  You must be a strong soul, for the Strength card suggests a powerful heart.  However, the reversed Sun brings a sense of melancholy to the equation.  It's as though the warmth and light of love are obscured, perhaps by doubt or uncertainty. 

The reversed Six of Moons, my dear, represents a retreat from the past.  Perhaps this love is tied to something that has passed, a memory or a time that can't be revisited.  It's a difficult card, suggesting a need for letting go.  

Sometimes, even with the strongest heart, the path to love isn't a straight one.  But remember, dear traveler, every journey has its twists and turns.  Perhaps a new path awaits, one leading towards a brighter sun.
